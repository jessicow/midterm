In the vibrant borough of Bronx, New York, Amaarae entered the world as the firstborn to Ama Bawuah and Kwadwo Boateng Genfi. However, her upbringing was a tale spun between the bustling streets of Atlanta, United States, and the rhythmic heartbeat of Accra, Ghana. Nestled into a family dynamic of two siblings, Amaarae's journey into the world of music began to weave its melodic threads at the young age of 13.

Amaarae's childhood was a harmonious amalgamation of genres. From the soulful tunes of Nina Simone and Aretha Franklin at home to the swaggering rap style of 50 Cent discovered through a cousin, her musical palette blossomed. Atlanta introduced her to the 808-driven stylings of Southern rappers, while New Jersey provided a canvas for her personal style experimentation, oscillating between goth influences and street style, with a dash of alternative rock and punk.

In the cocoon of her high school years in Ghana, Amaarae imbibed the DIY culture that surrounded her, laying the groundwork for her entrepreneurial spirit. She not only sold mixtapes to classmates but also delved into producing and engineering. This multifaceted skill set proved invaluable when she later established her independent record label, Golden Child Entertainment Ltd.

A metamorphosis unfolded as Amaarae transitioned from sardonically penning her future into notebooks to becoming the singer-songwriter she is today. One of her earliest songwriting endeavors, a playful riff on R. Kelly and Usher's "Same Girl," birthed her first song at the age of 13. Her journey through experimentation and evolution led to her proclamation as a "warrior princess," characterized by her instantly recognizable, mellifluous whisper-singing, pristine production, and emotionally charged songwriting.

Her pursuit of musical excellence didn't waver during her tertiary education. Alongside her academic endeavors, Amaarae delved into voice training and meticulously honed her songwriting skills while navigating the realms of English literature. The symphony of her education and passion reached a crescendo when she returned to her roots in Ghana, marking a significant homecoming in June 2017.</p>

			Amaarae's musical journey embarked in 2017 with the release of her debut project, "Passionfruit Summers." Since then, this Ghanaian-American singer-songwriter, producer, and engineer has evolved into a distinctive force, leaving an indelible mark on the ever-evolving musical landscape. Nurtured between Accra, Ghana, Atlanta, Georgia, and New Jersey, her cross-cultural odyssey serves as the creative impetus behind her deeply experimental ethos and emotive writing style.

			In November 2020, Amaarae released her debut studio album, "The Angel You Don't Know," hailed by Owen Myers of Pitchfork as a trailblazer at a time when Africa sets the global tempo for pop music. Fast forward to May 2022, where she shared an intimate moment with Kendrick Lamar during his visit to Ghana, culminating in a private album listening party for his project "Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers."

June 9, 2023, marked another milestone as Amaarae unleashed her sophomore album, "Fountain Baby," under the banner of Interscope Records. Accompanying this release was the groundbreaking news that she had become the first Ghanaian to grace the prestigious NPR Tiny Desk series, solidifying her status as a trailblazer in the global music scene. Amaarae's journey continues to be a testament to her musical prowess, artistic evolution, and unapologetic embrace of her unique identity.
